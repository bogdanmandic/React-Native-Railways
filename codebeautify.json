The steering of railway axles is achieved through the rolling radius difference between the left and the right wheel on an axle. In a common turnout, when a wheel makes the transition from the stock rail to the switch point, the contact point between rail and wheel moves outward to a smaller rolling radius on the wheel. This causes as a rule a steering effect with negative effects on the wheel - rail interface, e. g. by travelling into the deviation the axle starts initially to turn towards the outside of the curve and the flange of the wheel rides against the gauge face of the outside switch point. These results in high lateral forces and increased wear on the switch point. When travelling straight through the turnout the axle again starts to turn. In this case towards the straight switch rail, and the flange of the wheel once more rides against the gauge face causing increased wear. By slightly widening the gauge in the transition area of the switches the adverse steering effect caused by the rolling radius difference is reduced to a large extent. The running edge geometry of the stock rail is modified in such a way that the wheels steer in the right direction at the right time. This avoids hard flange contact of the wheels and the switch points, reduces the lateral forces and so also reduces wear of the components.In these turnouts the switch points become thicker much more rapidly which makes the points more steady and at the same time give more wear allowance. Also the switch point thickness is increased in the most sensitive area of a switch rails considerably providing more material for wearing off or maintenance work.","updateDate":"1511617694","sort":"2","files":[{"fileId":"1071","pageId":"366","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"145649","hash":"7fc3b79200d112907482d3ab515959b3","updateDate":"1511563744","sort":"1","filename":"1071"},{"fileId":"1072","pageId":"366","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"339604","hash":"b834605262dc75c195abf9686f514e76","updateDate":"1511563744","sort":"2","filename":"1072"},{"fileId":"1073","pageId":"366","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"154605","hash":"4ace64d0340654d567262b17d7688b21","updateDate":"1511563744","sort":"3","filename":"1073"}]},{"pageId":"367","menuId":"297","templateId":"3","title":"Set of switches with an optimized carrying capacity (TOZ)","subtitle":"Reinforced in the critical front area","text":"Set of switches of turnouts are exposed to particularly high strains and stresses.

Regarding its fastening properties, it corresponds to a common rail fastening in the track and exhibits high reliability. The plate is designed to meet the requirement for improved environment protection and minimised maintenance effort.The pace-setting development enables the integration of an elastic switch roller in the slide chair of the inner stock rail fastening IBaV &ndash; System Brandenburg.Design and FunctionA slide chair separated from the ribbed plate fastens the foot of the stock rail on the ribbed plate by means of a spring at a force of at least 10 kN. As there are pads below the stock rail and also below the slide chair, the switch rests on the slide chair under conditions similar to track fastening conditions.Creep resistance values of the stock rail are also similar to the values of the track. A protection against \"tilting\" secures the position of the stock rail at any time.ApplicationThe inner stockrail fastening IBaV &ndash; System Brandenburg can be used for all turnouts and is available for almost all commonly used rail profils. For elastically installed turnouts of different stiffness grades solutions are offered as well. As the slide chair is separated from the ribbed plate, the stock rail is easy to install and in case of wear the slide chair can be exchanged without problems.The slide-chair plate with the integrated resilient switch roller and the corrosion-resistant, coated slide plates and slide-chair plates make the turnout a low-maintenance product. The most important advantage of this integrated solution is that no components are stored in the sleeper spacings any more, which in turn makes track maintenance a lot easier.HighlightsElastic support of stock rail and switch railIncreased creep resistance of the stock railEasy assembly of stock rail and switch railHigh safety by two independent springsNo breakage hazard due to notch effectIntegrated switch rollers possibleEasy replacement of worn slide chairsLow maintenance effortHigh availabilityFast payback","updateDate":"1511617750","sort":"2","files":[{"fileId":"1094","pageId":"377","type":"document","ext":"pdf","size":"3859367","hash":"e49ced7544beb64a60216ba6a6db7b1d","updateDate":"1511563745","sort":"2","filename":"1094"},{"fileId":"1093","pageId":"377","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"941376","hash":"a5936c64a39bbce78d7831aa8be3dc28","updateDate":"1511563745","sort":"1","filename":"1093"}]},{"pageId":"378","menuId":"299","templateId":"3","title":"Inner stock rail fastening iFAST","subtitle":"Easy device for the flexible fastening of stock rails","text":"For the fastening of rails,&nbsp;spring elements are frequently used.

There is a raised part on the base plate, on&nbsp;which the dent of the spring element locks into place and thus fixes the spring&nbsp;in its parked position (pre-assembly).

As a response to that, voestalpine BWG has developed a wear-resistant set of switches for mass transit turnouts.With this construction, a thorough monoblock made of steel of a highly wear-resistant quality is used for the entire area of the running surface so as to work against working wear, high maintenance costs and an early exchange of components.An adaptation to the connection profile is a given option at any time through both the variable design of the head in the monoblock and the sandwich construction, whose height is variable. Furthermore, it offers the possibility of installing an energy-efficient, insulated heating system. With this construction, which features the responsible conservation of resources, we are contributing to a positive ecological balance.ApplicationThe monoblock set of switches developed by voestalpine BWG, which makes feasible a needsbased selection of materials as\nwell as a variable selection of profiles, can be deployed in all areas of mass transit with grooved rails. The rail head materials with high wear-resistance used here are designed both for deployment in highly stressed areas and for a long service life. Hence expenditures for maintenance and repair are substantially reduced. Revisions or the exchange of defective parts can be completed within a very short time thanks to the tried-and-tested switch adapter. The development of an insulated switch heating system enables a substantial reduction of energy needs for the provision of functional reliability in the cold season.

To protect them against wear the used steel has to be more robust than in the construction of other components.Due to its special construction, the voestalpine BWG Switch Adapter ZAD meets all demands in connection with long service life, easy maintenance and high profitability.Design and FunctionThe design of the tramway switch with clamping wedge consists of the following basic elements:Tramway switch rail with 30° or 45° inclined joint and dovetail guideStandard rail with 30° or 45° inclined jointSwitch adapter with clamping wedge, linkage components and anti-creeperThe 30° inclined joint ensures low-wear and smooth running from the switch to the standard rail. The dovetail guide with the screwed clamping wedges provides not only non-positive but also positive connection. The fitted anti-creeper represents another safety element against longitudinal movement of the switch. ApplicationDue to the narrow design of switch rails in tramway turnouts, smaller wheel contact surface areas occur resulting in surface\npressures considerably higher than on rails in a normal trackway. Therefore, materials of higher strength against the rolling/sliding wear have to be used. This nearly always entails poor welding properties. To eliminate difficult and expensive welding and, nevertheless, to use materials of high resistance and adequate carbon and manganese contents in the area of the switch, voestalpine BWG developed the Switch Adapter ZAD.The design is based on a positive and nonpositive, permanent bolted connection of the components. This is a profitable way to achieve long service life, to minimize maintenance costs substantially and to perform repairs in the track within an extremely short period of time by replacing damaged parts.HighlightsCombination of different materialsLow-wear running area thanks to 30° or 45° inclined jointsSafe non-positive and positive connectionsShort installation timesLow maintenanceHigh degree of availabilityFast payback","updateDate":"1511563747","sort":"4","files":[{"fileId":"1186","pageId":"419","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"188148","hash":"097352c0a4d6507ac8d2fd67586f19a8","updateDate":"1511563747","sort":"1","filename":"1186"}]},{"pageId":"420","menuId":"314","templateId":"1","title":"Crossings","subtitle":"Urban Taffic","text":null,"updateDate":"1511563747","sort":"1","files":[{"fileId":"1187","pageId":"420","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"2635394","hash":"823a381ba6dcd8e3247b14f2c098372e","updateDate":"1511563747","sort":"1","filename":"1187"}]},{"pageId":"421","menuId":"314","templateId":"3","title":"Monoblock crossings","subtitle":"Running edges and guiding sides are executed with 1:6","text":"Standard Monoblock DesignBlock-type crossing with electrically welded closure rails.

In a common turnout, when a wheel makes the transition from the stock rail to the switch point, the contact point between rail and wheel moves outward to a smaller rolling radius on the wheel. This causes as a rule a steering effect with negative effects on the wheel - rail interface, e. g. by travelling into the deviation the axle starts initially to turn towards the outside of the curve and the flange of the wheel rides against the gauge face of the outside switch point. These results in high lateral forces and increased wear on the switch point. When travelling straight through the turnout the axle again starts to turn. In this case towards the straight switch rail, and the flange of the wheel once more rides against the gauge face causing increased wear.By slightly widening the gauge in the transition area of the switches the adverse steering effect caused by the rolling radius difference is reduced to a large extent. The running edge geometry of the stock rail is  modified in such a way that the wheels steer in the right direction at the right time. This avoids hard flange contact of the wheels and the switch points, reduces the lateral forces and so also reduces wear of the components.In these turnouts the switch points become thicker much more rapidly which makes the points more steady and at the same time give more wear allowance.\n\nAlso the switch point thickness is increased in the most sensitive area of a switch rails considerably providing more material for wearing off or maintenance work.\n","updateDate":"1511563761","sort":"1","files":[{"fileId":"1529","pageId":"593","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"145649","hash":"7fc3b79200d112907482d3ab515959b3","updateDate":"1511563761","sort":"1","filename":"1529"},{"fileId":"1530","pageId":"593","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"339604","hash":"b834605262dc75c195abf9686f514e76","updateDate":"1511563761","sort":"2","filename":"1530"},{"fileId":"1531","pageId":"593","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"154605","hash":"4ace64d0340654d567262b17d7688b21","updateDate":"1511563761","sort":"3","filename":"1531"}]},{"pageId":"594","menuId":"401","templateId":"3","title":"Set of switches with an optimized carrying capacity (TOZ)","subtitle":"Improved contact geometry between the wheel and switch rail","text":"Set of switches of turnouts are exposed to particularly high strains and stresses. The bent (contra flexure) switch rail in turnouts with medium and small deflection radii and curved turnouts, in particular, is exposed to high horizontal guiding forces, which will lead to an increased lateral wear of the switch rail. This will result in high maintenance expenditure and a restricted lying period of the switch rail.As for set of switches with an optimized carrying capacity, the switch rail will exactly be reinforced in the critical front area while taking back the stock rail on the stopping face to the same extent (Figure 1).In this respect, the design is chosen as to make sure that the deviation of the driving edge of the stock rail from the straight line is very low and thus will not lead to any impairment of the running behavior. This has been confirmed by a simulation calculation and in practice.The transition from the stopping face to the head of the stock rail is designed as to highly reduce occurring of squeezing in this area of the stock rail during operation.In addition, a changed lowering on the switch rail will help to improve the contact geometry between the wheel and switch rail.The same principle can also be used for the straight switch rails.

The rolling wheels, through discontinuities in wheel and rail, generate additional forces and severe vibrations. With speed acceleration, these forces are magnified, thus leading to rapid wear of the entire trackway and a corresponding displacement of the track. Furthermore, the turnout is influenced by the steady change of contact points between wheel and rail, when set of switches and frog are overrun. A permanent and proven remedy is achieved through the use of Elastic Ribbed Base Plate Support ERL, a voestalpine BWG development.Design and FunctionSpring rigidity can be adjusted according to the individual customer requirements and applications – the deflection always indicated by a kinked spring characteristic. This means that in case of rail breakage, the deflection is limited to a pre-defined extent. Given the elasticity of the rail support, the incurred forces are compensated by several support points in the form of a bending curve of the rail. The load on each individual support point and the elastic support is thus accordingly reduced.Application\nFor systems of average track rigidity (85 kN/mm), the turnouts in the area of the set of switches as well as in the frog area are equipped with the ERL 30 system plates. The support points in the intermediate rail area are equipped with elastic rail pads, just as in the track. For systems of low track rigidity (65 kN/mm), the turnouts are provided with ERL 17.5 system plates. For this type of turnouts, which are laid in ballast, additional transition areas in front of and behind the turnout have to be equipped with staggered spring rigidities, depending on speed. This is to compensate for the difference in track rigidity between the turnout and the adjacent rail track. For systems in slab track, the turnout is also generally provided with system ERL 17.5 plates. However, here the elastic transitions in front and behind the turnout are omitted. For easy adjustment of track and level discontinuities, all ERL plates in the screwing area feature tapered sleeve inserts permitting a horizontal correction of ERL of +/- 9 mm. Level compensations of -4 mm to +26 mm, respectively, are possible at any time using leveling shims. For any vertical corrections exceeding this level, the screws need to be replaced.\n\nHighlights\nForces are decomposed where they ariseRapid and easy correction of horizontal and vertical positional displacementsSubstantial minimization of permanent track way maintenanceIndividually adjustable spring rigidityKinked spring characteristics ensuring high safetyLittle maintenance effortHigh availabilityFast payback\n","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","files":[{"fileId":"1374","pageId":"506","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"524132","hash":"2919258c36d2196782f5236950463e6d","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","filename":"1374"}]},{"pageId":"507","menuId":"416","templateId":"2","title":"Rail expansion joints","subtitle":"Special expansion lengths are likewise possible","text":"","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","files":[{"fileId":"1375","pageId":"507","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"3019080","hash":"2ff76362a4e0d748328cb08914407613","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","filename":"1375"}]},{"pageId":"508","menuId":"416","templateId":"3","title":"Rail expansion joints","subtitle":"","text":"In the high-speed area, rail expansion joint are basically provided as a switch / stock rail version.

The steering of railway axles is achieved through the rolling radius difference between the left and the right wheel on an axle. In a common turnout, when a wheel makes the transition from the stock rail to the switch point, the contact point between rail and wheel moves outward to a smaller rolling radius on the wheel. This causes as a rule a steering effect with negative effects on the wheel - rail interface, e. g. by travelling into the deviation the axle starts initially to turn towards the outside of the curve and the flange of the wheel rides against the gauge face of the outside switch point. These results in high lateral forces and increased wear on the switch point. When travelling straight through the turnout the axle again starts to turn. In this case towards the straight switch rail, and the flange of the wheel once more rides against the gauge face causing increased wear. By slightly widening the gauge in the transition area of the switches the adverse steering effect caused by the rolling radius difference is reduced to a large extent. The running edge geometry of the stock rail is  modified in such a way that the wheels steer in the right direction at the right time. This avoids hard flange contact of the wheels and the switch points, reduces the lateral forces and so also reduces wear of the components.In these turnouts the switch points become thicker much more rapidly which makes the points more steady and at the same time give more wear allowance.\n\nAlso the switch point thickness is increased in the most sensitive area of a switch rails considerably providing more material for wearing off or maintenance work.\n\n","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","files":[{"fileId":"1381","pageId":"509","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"145649","hash":"7fc3b79200d112907482d3ab515959b3","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"1","filename":"1381"},{"fileId":"1382","pageId":"509","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"339604","hash":"b834605262dc75c195abf9686f514e76","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"2","filename":"1382"},{"fileId":"1383","pageId":"509","type":"image","ext":"jpg","size":"157042","hash":"61f6c1d665ce259d13973f18d85d5877","updateDate":"1511563756","sort":"3","filename":"1383"}]},{"pageId":"510","menuId":"418","templateId":"3","title":"Set of switches with an optimized carrying capacity (TOZ)","subtitle":"Improved contact geometry between the wheel and switch rail","text":"Set of switches of turnouts are exposed to particularly high strains and stresses. The bent (contra flexure) switch rail in turnouts with medium and small deflection radii and curved turnouts, in particular, is exposed to high horizontal guiding forces, which will lead to an increased lateral wear of the switch rail. This will result in high maintenance expenditure and a restricted lying period of the switch rail.As for set of switches with an optimized carrying capacity, the switch rail will exactly be reinforced in the critical front area while taking back the stock rail on the stopping face to the same extent (Figure 1). In this respect, the design is chosen as to make sure that the deviation of the driving edge of the stock rail from the straight line is very low and thus will not lead to any impairment of the running behavior. This has been confirmed by a simulation calculation and in practice. The transition from the stopping face to the head of the stock rail is designed as to highly reduce occurring of squeezing in this area of the stock rail during operation. In addition, a changed lowering on the switch rail will help to improve the contact geometry between the wheel and switch rail. The same principle can also be used for the straight switch rails.

This also guarantees that the switch rail and the stock rail have the same height even in case of elastic subsidence of the stock rail. The switch attachment BKL 80 is designed such that a correct setting movement is ensured even if the switch rail moves +/-40 mm relative to the stock rail. All setting movements are carried out via low-maintenance rollers; there are no sliding components which require high maintenance.Application\nThe HRS Locking Device can be used for all common rail profiles both in switch devices and movable frogs.\nThe voestalpine BWG product is state-of-the-art in high-speed lines, but it is also commonly used and proven for all other fields of application.
